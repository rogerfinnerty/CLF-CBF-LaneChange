# CLF-CBF Automated Lane Change Simulation
Created by Roger Finnerty for ME570, Fall 2023

Python implementation of CLF-CBF-QP formulation for autonomous lane changing, based on MATLAB implementation from: 

Rule-Based Safety-Critical Control Design using Control Barrier Functions with Application to Autonomous Lane Change
Suiyi He, Jun Zeng, Bike Zhang and Koushil Sreenath

The contribution of this work is to include the in the control model a parameter representing the uncertainty in the grade of the road. 

## Prerequisites 
pip install numpy matplotlib cvxopt

## Usage
All results were generated by running functions in main.py.

1. To view the animation of a test lane change scenario and generate the velocity, steering, and yaw logs, run *test_simulation()* in main.py. 
2. To create the lane change time vs uncertainty parameter plot, run *alpha_test()* in main.py.
